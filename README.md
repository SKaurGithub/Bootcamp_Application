This project was built with the goal of validating the input an user provides for an application according the application's criteria.

Focus:

- Adding an intro and input requests.
- Input validation, which will make sure that the program will not crash if the user enters invalid data.
- Adding the option for the user to review data entered and to make changes if necessary.
